# Save and load Mesh-Bed-Value/Grid

I need always a lot of time, when i add my mesh bed levling settings, after some updates, like Marlin firmware.

So i wrote a site, which convert the old Mesh Settings into a full gCode.
I use repetier to get the current mesh bed settings. (G29 S0)

I copy-paste the output, click convert and get a full gcode, to add the mesh.

IT WILL BE SAVE and DOWNLOAD automatically as gcode.
save it on the SD-Card an run. Finish

### Important:
Save current mesh, before flash or update!
